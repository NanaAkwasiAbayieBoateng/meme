# Meme Generation in R

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/meme.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/meme)

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme):

>An Internet meme (/'mi?m/ meem) is an activity, concept, catchphrase or piece of media which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the Internet.

**meme** is an R package that connects with several online image generators to create internet memes, which can then be loaded into R, plotted, and saved locally.

## Installation ##

At some point **meme** will be [available on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meme/index.html) and installed from within R from your favorite CRAN mirror:

```
install.packages("meme")
```

The latest development version, available here, can be installed directly using Hadley Wickham's [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package:

```
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("leeper/meme")
```
